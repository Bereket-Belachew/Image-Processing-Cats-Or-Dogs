## üìä Project Structure

- **Image Loading & Labeling**: All images are read and labeled (`0` for cats, `1` for dogs).
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied using `ImageDataGenerator`.
- **Model Architecture**: Simple CNN with 3 convolutional layers.
- **Training**: Model is trained for 10 epochs with data generators.
- **Visualization**: Example images and accuracy graphs are plotted.
